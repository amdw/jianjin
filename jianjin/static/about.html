  <li>Keep track of which words you find most difficult so you can focus on those</li>

<p>The name &quot;Jianjin&quot; comes from a Chinese idiom, <a href="http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=worddict&wdrst=0&wdqb=%E5%BE%AA%E5%BA%8F%E6%B8%90%E8%BF%9B">循序渐进</a> (x&#250;n x&#249; ji&#224;n j&#236;n), which means &quot;to make steady progress step-by-step&quot;.</p>
